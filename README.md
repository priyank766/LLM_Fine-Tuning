# LLM Fine-Tuning & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Comparison

This repository demonstrates and compares two advanced approaches for customizing Large Language Models (LLMs): **Fine-Tuning** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Both methods are implemented and evaluated here using real-world company profile data.

---

## Project Structure

- **llm_ft.py / LLM_FT.ipynb**: Implements LLM fine-tuning using the Llama-2-7b-chat-hf model with PEFT/LoRA techniques.
- **RAG Implementation**: Uses Gemmini (or similar) with a retrieval-augmented pipeline to answer questions based on external knowledge.
- **web.html**: Interactive web profile for TechNova Solutions Inc.
- **README.md**: This documentation and comparison.

## Key Technologies

- **Transformers (HuggingFace)**
- **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
- **BitsAndBytes (Quantization)**
- **GPUtil (GPU Monitoring)**
- **Gemmini (for RAG)**
- **WandB (Weights & Biases) for experiment tracking**

---

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   See the first cells of `LLM_FT.ipynb` or `llm_ft.py` for pip install commands.

2. **Fine-Tuning**  
   - Run the notebook or script to fine-tune Llama-2-7b-chat-hf on your company data.
   - Uses LoRA for efficient adaptation.

3. **RAG**  
   - Set up the retrieval pipeline (see RAG section/code).
   - Uses Gemmini as the retriever and a language model as the generator.

4. **Experiment Tracking**  
   - Optionally enable WandB for logging and visualization.

## RAG vs Fine-Tuning: Comparison Table

| **Aspect**           | **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**                                 | **Fine-Tuning**                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Uses a language model + external knowledge base for dynamic answers      | Updates model weights for a specific task/domain    |
| **Data Dependency**  | Relies on external, updatable knowledge sources                         | Needs curated, static training data                 |
| **Adaptability**     | Highly adaptable via KB updates                                         | Requires retraining for new knowledge               |
| **Response Quality** | Up-to-date, factual responses                                           | Excels at domain-specific, nuanced responses        |
| **Inference Speed**  | Slower (retrieval step involved)                                        | Faster (direct generation, no retrieval)            |
| **Offline Use**      | Needs access to external KB                                             | Can run fully offline after training                |
| **Scalability**      | Scales well with large, dynamic datasets                                | Less scalable for rapidly changing info             |
| **Implementation**   | More complex (retriever + generator)                                    | Simpler (single model)                              |

*In this repository, both approaches are implemented: LLM fine-tuning uses a Llama-2-7b-chat-hf model, while RAG uses Gemmini as the retriever. RAG is more popular for real-world applications due to its flexibility, scalability, and ability to stay current without retraining.*

## Pros & Cons

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Pros:**
- No need for extensive model retraining
- Always up-to-date if KB is updated
- Scalable for large and dynamic datasets

**Cons:**
- Dependent on external knowledge base quality and availability
- Slower inference due to retrieval step
- More complex system architecture

---

### Fine-Tuning

**Pros:**
- Highly tailored to specific tasks or domains
- Fast inference, no retrieval overhead
- Works offline, no external dependencies

**Cons:**
- Requires significant compute for training
- Needs a well-curated, static dataset
- Not easily updated for new information

---

## Implementation in This Repository

- **Fine-Tuning**:  
  - Implemented using Llama-2-7b-chat-hf and LoRA/PEFT for efficient adaptation to company-specific data.
- **RAG**:  
  - Implemented using Gemmini as the retriever and a language model as the generator, enabling dynamic, knowledge-augmented responses.

## Why RAG Is More Popular and Effective

In practice, **RAG** is often preferred for real-world applications because:
- It allows the model to access the latest information without retraining.
- It is more scalable for organizations with frequently changing or large datasets.
- It reduces the need for expensive, repeated fine-tuning cycles.
- It is easier to maintain and update (just update the knowledge base).

**In this project, RAG provided more relevant and up-to-date answers compared to the fine-tuned model, especially when the underlying data changed or expanded.**

## Summary

Both LLM fine-tuning and RAG were implemented and evaluated in this repository. While fine-tuning offers fast, domain-specific responses, RAG proved to be more flexible and practical for real-world, dynamic information needs. The learning experience was valuable, but for production-grade applications, RAG currently offers more advantages in terms of scalability, maintainability,
